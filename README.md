# book_app
# Server-side templating with EJS

**Author**: Adara Townsend and Jean McMahon
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This week, you and your partner(s) will implement a basic full-stack application for a book list which will include the ability to search the Google Books API, add books to a database, and then render those books from a PostgreSQL database. You will also add the ability to update the details of a book or remove it from the collection.



## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named book_app. Add your partner as collaborator. 
2. One person from your group should create an instance on Heroku. You will be working in this same instance for labs 11 through 14.
Follow the naming convention of <\partner 1 initials>-<\partner 2 initials>-booklist. For example, Allie and Sam’s instance would be named https://ag-sh-booklist.herokuapp.com
3. In the Deploy tab, connect your instance to your repository and enable automatic deploys from your master branch. Deploy your application and make sure there are no errors.
4. From this point on, work on semantically-named non-master branches. Once your app is functioning correctly on your branch, make a PR to master and confirm functionality on your deployed site. Your deployed site should not contain any broken functionality.

###### Trello
1. We will be using the Trello project management tool for the duration of this project.
2. Go to the Open Book Trello Board, open the “… Show Menu” link, click the “… More” link, and then click “Copy Board”. Before you create it, be sure to “Change” from Private to “Public” (and click “Yes, Make Board Public”) so your instructional team can see your work. Now, click “Create” to add a copy to your personal account.
3. On the Settings tab, click the “Filter” link to view just the current day
4. With your partner, review the user stories and analyze the feature requests and requirements in the lab.
5. Within each story, note the acceptance criteria (“Given … When … Then…”) and the checklist of feature tasks. Be careful to execute tasks in order as they are often dependencies of one another.
6. During the day with your partner, check off tasks as you complete them, and move the story cards through the workflow.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->




## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
